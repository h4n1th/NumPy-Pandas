Numpy and Pandas
This repository contains my first experiments with NumPy and Pandas in Python.
I created this repo to practice and understand the basics of data manipulation, arrays, and data analysis using these two powerful libraries.

ðŸ“š What I Learned
While working on this repository, I explored:

NumPy
Creating 1D and 2D arrays

Array operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)

Basic statistical operations (mean, max, min)

Reshaping arrays

Pandas
Creating Series and DataFrames

Reading data from CSV files

Selecting and filtering data

Performing basic operations like sum, mean, describe()

Handling missing data
