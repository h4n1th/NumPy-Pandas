# Numpy and Pandas

This repository contains my first experiments with **NumPy** and **Pandas** in Python.
I created this repo to practice and understand the basics of **data manipulation, arrays, and data analysis** using these two powerful libraries.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

While working on this repository, I explored:

### **NumPy**

* Creating 1D and 2D arrays
* Array operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
* Basic statistical operations (mean, max, min)
* Reshaping arrays

### **Pandas**

* Creating **Series** and **DataFrames**
* Reading data from CSV files
* Selecting and filtering data
* Performing basic operations like **sum, mean, describe()**
* Handling missing data
